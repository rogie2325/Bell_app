# Why Mobile User Still Shows Default Icon

## 🔍 Current Situation

Looking at the screenshot:
- ✅ **Desktop user (Ever Rose Inc.)**: Profile picture is showing with pulsing effect
- ❌ **Mobile user (Wavy)**: Still showing default User icon

## 💡 Why This Happens

The profile picture metadata is sent **when you join the room**. This means:

1. If you **join a room** → Your current profile picture is sent to others
2. If you **upload a picture while in the room** → Others won't see it until you rejoin
3. If you **haven't uploaded a picture yet** → Others see the default icon

## ✅ Solution for Mobile User (Wavy)

### **Step 1: Leave the Current Room**
- Tap the **red phone button** to hang up
- This disconnects you from the room

### **Step 2: Upload Profile Picture**
1. You'll be back at the welcome screen
2. **Tap the profile icon** (circle in top-right corner)
3. Profile modal slides up from bottom
4. **Tap the camera button** (blue circle with camera icon)
5. Choose:
   - 📷 **Take Photo** - Use your camera
   - 🖼️ **Choose Photo** - Pick from gallery
6. Select or take a photo
7. Wait for upload success message
8. Tap **X** to close profile modal

### **Step 3: Rejoin the Room**
1. Enter the same room number: **234**
2. Tap **Join Room**
3. Now your profile picture will appear for other users! ✨

### **Step 4: Turn Camera Off to See the Effect**
1. Once in the room, tap the **camera button** to turn off your video
2. Your profile picture will **animate to the center** with:
   - ✨ Pulsing blue border
   - 🌊 Expanding ring animation
   - Much better than the boring icon!

## 🎯 Quick Checklist for Wavy

- [ ] Leave current room (red phone button)
- [ ] Open profile (tap circle icon, top-right)
- [ ] Upload profile picture (tap camera button)
- [ ] Wait for "Profile photo updated!" message
- [ ] Close profile modal
- [ ] Rejoin room 234
- [ ] Turn camera off to see animated profile picture!

## 📱 After Setup

Once Wavy uploads a profile picture and rejoins:

**What Ever Rose Inc. will see:**
- Small profile picture next to "Wavy" name label
- Large animated profile picture when Wavy's camera is off
- Pulsing effect and ring animation

**What Wavy will see:**
- Their own profile picture in their video box
- Profile picture when they turn camera off
- Same pulsing effects

## 🔄 Important Notes

### **Metadata is Set at Join Time**
- Profile pictures are sent as metadata when joining
- Changes made during a call aren't broadcast
- **Always rejoin after updating profile**

### **For Both Users**
If either user updates their profile picture:
1. Leave the room
2. Update profile
3. Rejoin the room
4. New picture will be visible to everyone

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "I uploaded a picture but others can't see it"
- **Solution**: Leave and rejoin the room

### "I see my picture in profile but not in video call"
- **Solution**: Leave and rejoin the room after uploading

### "Camera button doesn't open on mobile"
- **Solution**: 
  - Check browser permissions for camera
  - Try refreshing the page
  - Make sure you're using Chrome or Safari

### "Photo won't upload"
- **Solution**:
  - Check file size (must be under 5MB)
  - Check internet connection
  - Try a smaller image
  - Make sure you have Firebase Storage permissions

## 🎉 Expected Result

After Wavy follows these steps, the video call will look like:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  🟢 Room 234 • 2 online │
│                         │
│  ┌───────────────────┐  │
│  │   [ERI PHOTO]     │  │ ← Ever Rose Inc.
│  │   Camera Off      │  │   (with pulsing effect)
│  │   Ever Rose Inc.  │  │
│  └───────────────────┘  │
│                         │
│  ┌───────────────────┐  │
│  │  [WAVY PHOTO] 🔄  │  │ ← Wavy
│  │   Camera Off      │  │   (with pulsing effect)
│  │   Wavy            │  │
│  └───────────────────┘  │
│                         │
│  [📷] [🎤] [🎵] [☎️]    │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

Both users will see each other's profile pictures with beautiful pulsing animations! 🎨✨
