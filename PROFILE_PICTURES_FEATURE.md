# Profile Pictures in Video Rooms - Feature Implementation

## âœ¨ What's New

Profile pictures now appear in video calls with beautiful animations!

## ðŸŽ¯ Features Implemented

### 1. **Profile Picture Next to Name**
- Small circular profile picture appears next to each participant's name in the video box
- Visible at all times during the call
- Bordered with white/30 opacity for elegance
- Size: 20x20px (small) or 24x24px (normal)

### 2. **Animated Center Display When Camera Off**
- When a user turns off their camera, their profile picture:
  - Animates to the center of the video box
  - Displays at larger size (80x80px mobile, 128x128px desktop)
  - Has a pulsing border effect (blue glow)
  - Has an animated ping ring around it
  - Replaces the boring "User" icon

### 3. **Fallback Behavior**
- If user has no profile picture:
  - Shows default User/VideoOff icon
  - Still has pulsing animation
  - Maintains consistent design

### 4. **Local User Display**
- Your own profile picture shows in your video box
- Appears next to "You" label at bottom
- Centers with pulse animation when camera is off

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes (`SimpleLiveKitApp.jsx`)

1. **Metadata Transmission**:
   ```javascript
   metadata: JSON.stringify({
     photoURL: currentUser?.photoURL || null,
     bio: currentUser?.bio || null,
   })
   ```

2. **Safe Metadata Parsing**:
   - Try-catch blocks to prevent crashes
   - Graceful fallback if metadata is invalid

3. **Profile Picture Display**:
   - In name badge (always visible)
   - In camera-off overlay (center, animated)

### Backend Changes (`api/token.js`)

1. **Accept Metadata Parameter**:
   ```javascript
   const { roomName, participantName, metadata } = req.body;
   ```

2. **Include in Access Token**:
   ```javascript
   const at = new AccessToken(LIVEKIT_API_KEY, LIVEKIT_SECRET, {
     identity: participantName,
     ttl: '1h',
     metadata: metadata || '',
   });
   ```

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Effects

- **Pulsing Border**: Blue gradient border that pulses
- **Ping Animation**: Expanding ring effect around profile picture
- **Smooth Transitions**: All animations use CSS transitions
- **Responsive Sizing**: Adapts to screen size

## ðŸ“‹ How It Works

1. **User uploads profile picture** â†’ Saved to Firebase Storage
2. **User joins room** â†’ photoURL sent as metadata in token
3. **Other participants receive metadata** â†’ Parse and display photo
4. **Camera toggle** â†’ Show/hide photo with animation

## âœ… Complete Integration

- âœ… Works with Google Sign-In photos
- âœ… Works with uploaded profile photos
- âœ… Syncs with UserProfile component
- âœ… Error handling for missing photos
- âœ… Responsive on all devices
- âœ… Beautiful pulsing animations

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

Users can now:
1. Upload profile picture in their profile
2. Join a video room
3. See their picture next to their name
4. Turn off camera to see centered animated profile picture
5. See other users' profile pictures in the same way

## ðŸŽ‰ Result

The "boring out of shape icon" is now replaced with personalized, animated profile pictures that make video calls feel more engaging and personal!
