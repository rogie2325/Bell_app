# 🔧 Audio & Video Communication Fixes

## 🚨 **Critical Issues Fixed**

### **Audio Problems Resolved:**

1. **✅ Asymmetrical Audio**: Fixed by preventing track unpublishing during mute/unmute
2. **✅ Muting Breaks Audio**: Fixed by keeping tracks published and only muting/unmuting
3. **✅ General Audio Failures**: Enhanced audio context initialization for mobile devices

### **Video Problems Resolved:**

1. **✅ Camera Not Reappearing**: Fixed by keeping video tracks published and only muting/unmuting

## 🛠️ **Key Changes Made**

### **1. Fixed Audio/Video Toggle Logic**
- **Before**: Tracks were unpublished when muted, causing connection issues
- **After**: Tracks remain published, only muted/unmuted state changes

### **2. Enhanced Mobile Audio Support**
- Added proper audio context initialization
- Implemented retry logic for audio playback
- Added user interaction handlers for mobile audio context

### **3. Improved Track Management**
- Better error handling for track operations
- Enhanced logging for debugging
- Proper cleanup and re-attachment

## 🌐 **Better Alternative to ngrok**

### **Option 1: Use Railway (Recommended)**
```bash
# Deploy to Railway for free
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

### **Option 2: Use Vercel (Current Setup)**
Your app is already deployed on Vercel at: `https://bell-app.vercel.app`

### **Option 3: Use Cloudflare Tunnel**
```bash
# Install cloudflared
npm install -g cloudflared
# Create tunnel
cloudflared tunnel create bell-app
# Run tunnel
cloudflared tunnel run bell-app
```

### **Option 4: Use Tailscale (Most Secure)**
```bash
# Install Tailscale
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
# Start Tailscale
sudo tailscale up
# Share your machine
tailscale share 5173
```

## 🔧 **Environment Setup**

Create a `.env.local` file:
```env
VITE_LIVEKIT_URL=wss://your-livekit-server.com
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://bell-app.vercel.app
```

## 📱 **Mobile Testing**

### **For HTTPS Testing:**
1. Use the Vercel deployment: `https://bell-app.vercel.app`
2. Or use ngrok with HTTPS: `ngrok http 5173 --scheme=https`

### **For Local Testing:**
1. Use `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` (works on mobile if on same network)
2. Use your local IP address: `http://192.168.1.100:5173`

## 🎯 **Testing Checklist**

- [ ] Desktop user can hear mobile user
- [ ] Mobile user can hear desktop user  
- [ ] Muting/unmuting works without breaking audio
- [ ] Camera on/off works properly
- [ ] Video reappears after being turned off
- [ ] Audio works consistently across devices

## 🚀 **Deployment Commands**

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start
```

## 🔍 **Debugging Tips**

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for audio/video related errors
2. **Test Audio Context**: Check if `AudioContext.state` is 'running'
3. **Verify Track States**: Ensure tracks are published and not muted
4. **Network Issues**: Check if WebRTC connections are established
5. **Mobile Permissions**: Ensure camera/microphone permissions are granted

## 📞 **Support**

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify LiveKit server configuration
3. Test with different browsers/devices
4. Check network connectivity and firewall settings
