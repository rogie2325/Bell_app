# Camera-Off Profile Display Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the camera-off display to show user profile bios, allowing participants to see each other's profile information even when cameras are turned off. This creates a more connected and personal experience during video calls.

## Issue
- Participants could see profile pictures when cameras were off
- However, profile bios were not being displayed
- This limited the ability to learn about other participants when their video was disabled

## Solution

### Enhanced Remote Participant Camera-Off View

**What's Displayed:**
1. **Profile Picture** (if available)
   - Larger size: 24x24 mobile, 32x32 desktop
   - Rounded with border and shadow
   - Pulsing animation ring

2. **Username**
   - Bold, larger text (text-lg to text-xl)
   - Clearly visible display name

3. **Bio** (NEW!)
   - Displayed in italics with quotes
   - White with 80% opacity for softer look
   - Max-width for readability
   - Only shows if bio exists in metadata

4. **Camera Off Indicator**
   - Small VideoOff icon with text
   - Shows at bottom with proper spacing

### Enhanced Local User Camera-Off View

**What's Displayed:**
1. **Profile Picture** (if available)
   - Same styling as remote participants
   - Pulsing ring animation

2. **Username**
   - Shows "You" or user's display name
   - Bold, prominent text

3. **Bio** (NEW!)
   - Shows current user's bio from profile
   - Same styling as remote participants
   - Italic with quotes

4. **Camera Off Indicator**
   - VideoOff icon with text
   - Consistent with remote view

## Technical Implementation

### Remote Participant Bio Display

```jsx
{(() => {
  const metadata = getParticipantMetadata(participant);
  return metadata?.bio ? (
    <div className="text-sm md:text-base text-white/80 mt-2 italic max-w-xs mx-auto">
      "{metadata.bio}"
    </div>
  ) : null;
})()}
```

**Key Features:**
- Uses `getParticipantMetadata()` to parse participant's metadata
- Conditionally renders only if bio exists
- Responsive text sizing (text-sm on mobile, text-base on desktop)
- Max-width constraint for readability
- Italic with quotes for visual distinction

### Local User Bio Display

```jsx
{currentUser?.bio && (
  <div className="text-sm md:text-base text-white/80 mt-2 italic max-w-xs mx-auto">
    "{currentUser.bio}"
  </div>
)}
```

**Key Features:**
- Reads from `currentUser.bio` directly
- Same styling as remote participants for consistency
- Only shows when bio is set

## Design Decisions

### Typography
- **Username**: Bold, prominent (text-lg/xl)
- **Bio**: Italic, softer opacity (80%)
- **Camera Off**: Smaller, subtle (text-xs/sm)

### Layout
- **Vertical Stack**: Profile pic → Name → Bio → Status
- **Centered**: All elements centered for balance
- **Spacing**: Proper margins (mt-2) between elements
- **Max Width**: Constrains text width for readability

### Visual Hierarchy
1. Profile picture (largest, most prominent)
2. Username (bold, clear)
3. Bio (italicized, quoted)
4. Camera status (smallest, informational)

## Metadata Transmission

### How Bios Are Shared

When joining a room, the following metadata is sent:
```javascript
metadata: JSON.stringify({
  photoURL: currentUser?.photoURL || null,
  bio: currentUser?.bio || null,
})
```

This metadata is:
- Attached to the participant object
- Transmitted to all other participants
- Parsed by `getParticipantMetadata()`
- Displayed when camera is off

### Metadata Structure

```javascript
{
  photoURL: "https://...",  // Firebase Storage URL
  bio: "Music lover 🎵"      // User's bio text
}
```
