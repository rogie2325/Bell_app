      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId
                   && request.resource.size < 5 * 1024 * 1024

    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "users": {
      "$uid": {
        ".read": "auth != null",
        ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid === $uid",
        "bio": {
          ".validate": "newData.isString() && newData.val().length <= 150"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
