- Check Node.js version (Railway uses latest)

### App Won't Start?

**Check deployment logs:**
- View **"Deploy Logs"**
- Look for missing environment variables
- Verify LiveKit credentials are correct

**Test locally first:**
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Can't Connect to LiveKit?

- Double-check `LIVEKIT_URL` format: `wss://your-project.livekit.cloud`
- Verify API Key and Secret are correct
- Make sure no extra spaces in environment variables
