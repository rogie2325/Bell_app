## 📋 Firebase Configuration Required

### Step 1: Firebase Console Setup

1. **Enable Authentication Methods**

   - Click on your web app or create one
   - Copy the config values to your `.env` file

### Step 2: Update .env File

```

### Step 3: Test Authentication

   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Email/Password Sign-up:**
