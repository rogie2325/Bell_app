**State:**
- `currentUser` - Current authenticated user object
- `loading` - Auth initialization state
- `error` - Auth error messages

### `Auth.jsx`
Authentication UI with login, signup, and password reset forms.

**Features:**
- Toggle between login and signup
- Google sign-in button
- Forgot password flow
- Real-time validation
- Error handling

### `UserProfile.jsx`
User profile modal for viewing and editing profile information.

**Features:**

## Usage

### Accessing Current User

```javascript
import { useAuth } from '../contexts/AuthContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { currentUser, logout } = useAuth();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Hello, {currentUser.displayName || currentUser.email}!</p>
      <button onClick={logout}>Sign Out</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Protected Routes

The main `App.jsx` automatically shows the Auth component if no user is logged in:

```javascript
const AppContent = () => {
  const { currentUser, loading } = useAuth();
  
  if (loading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
  return currentUser ? <SimpleLiveKitApp /> : <Auth />;
};
```

### Using Username in LiveKit

The SimpleLiveKitApp component automatically uses the authenticated user's name:

```javascript
const [username, setUsername] = useState(
  currentUser?.displayName || 
  currentUser?.email?.split('@')[0] || 
  ''
);
```

## Firebase Setup

Make sure your `.env` file includes:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### Enable Authentication Methods

In Firebase Console:
1. Go to Authentication ‚Üí Sign-in method
2. Enable **Email/Password**
3. Enable **Google** (configure OAuth consent screen)

### Google Sign-in Setup

1. Enable Google provider in Firebase Console
2. Add authorized domains (localhost, your production domain)
3. Configure OAuth consent screen in Google Cloud Console
4. For production: Add privacy policy and terms of service URLs

## Security Features

- ‚úÖ Email validation
- ‚úÖ Password strength requirements
- ‚úÖ Secure token-based authentication
- ‚úÖ Protected routes (only authenticated users can access the app)
- ‚úÖ Automatic session management
- ‚úÖ Password reset via email
- ‚úÖ HTTPS required for mobile devices

## Mobile Considerations

- Google Sign-in uses redirect flow on mobile (better UX)
- Touch-optimized buttons and inputs
- Responsive design adapts to screen size
- PWA-compatible authentication flow

## Error Handling

The system provides user-friendly error messages for common scenarios:
- Invalid email format
- Account not found
- Incorrect password
- Email already in use
- Weak password
- Network errors

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:
- [ ] Phone number authentication
- [ ] Facebook/Twitter sign-in
- [ ] Email verification requirement
- [ ] Two-factor authentication
- [ ] Account deletion
- [ ] Profile photo upload
- [ ] Username change history
- [ ] Session timeout settings

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to sign in with Google"
- Check that Google provider is enabled in Firebase Console
- Verify authorized domains include your current domain
- For mobile: ensure using HTTPS

### "Email already in use"
- User already has an account with that email
- Try signing in instead
- Use password reset if forgot password

### "Popup closed by user"
- User closed Google sign-in popup before completing
- Try again or use email/password sign-in

## Testing

Test the authentication flow:
1. ‚úÖ Sign up with email/password
2. ‚úÖ Sign out
3. ‚úÖ Sign in with same credentials
4. ‚úÖ Test forgot password flow
5. ‚úÖ Sign in with Google
6. ‚úÖ Update profile name
7. ‚úÖ Sign out from profile menu
8. ‚úÖ Verify protected routes

**Note:** All authentication is handled securely by Firebase Authentication. User passwords are never stored in plain text.
