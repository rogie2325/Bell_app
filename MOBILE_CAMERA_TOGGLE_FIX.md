# Mobile Camera Toggle Fix

## Issue
Mobile users were unable to turn their camera off by tapping the video button.

## Root Cause
The video button had a nested `<button>` element for the three-dot menu icon, which was causing event propagation issues on mobile devices. When users tapped the main button, the nested button would intercept the click event, preventing the `toggleVideo` function from being called.

## Solution

### Changed nested button to div
**Before:**
```jsx
<button
  onClick={(e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    e.stopPropagation();
    setShowVideoMenu(!showVideoMenu);
  }}
  className="absolute -top-1 -right-1 bg-white/30 backdrop-blur-sm rounded-full p-0.5 opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity"
>
  <MoreVertical size={12} />
</button>
```

**After:**
```jsx
<div
  onClick={(e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    e.stopPropagation();
    setShowVideoMenu(!showVideoMenu);
  }}
  className="absolute -top-1 -right-1 bg-white/30 backdrop-blur-sm rounded-full p-1 cursor-pointer"
>
  <MoreVertical size={10} />
</div>
```

### Key Changes
1. **Changed `<button>` to `<div>`**: Eliminates button-within-button conflict
2. **Added `cursor-pointer`**: Maintains clickable appearance
3. **Removed `group-hover`**: The icon is now always visible on mobile (not dependent on hover)
4. **Increased padding**: `p-1` instead of `p-0.5` for better touch target
5. **Smaller icon**: `size={10}` instead of `size={12}` to fit better
6. **Wrapped video icon**: Added `<div>` wrapper with flex centering for proper alignment

### Enhanced Debugging
Added detailed console logging to `toggleVideo()` function:
- Shows current video state before toggle
- Confirms local video track exists
- Logs mute/unmute actions
- Shows new state after toggle
- Error logging if video track is missing

## Testing
Mobile users should now be able to:
1. ✅ Tap the video button to toggle camera on/off
2. ✅ Tap the three-dot icon (top-right corner) to open flip camera menu
3. ✅ See the button change color (white → red) when camera is off
4. ✅ See the icon change (Video → VideoOff) when camera is off
5. ✅ Feel haptic feedback on button press

## Files Modified
- `/src/components/SimpleLiveKitApp.jsx`
  - Changed nested button to div for menu icon
  - Added wrapper div around video icon
  - Enhanced logging in toggleVideo function

## Result
✅ Mobile users can now toggle their camera on/off without issues  
✅ Flip camera menu remains accessible via three-dot icon  
✅ Better touch target separation between main and menu buttons  
✅ Enhanced debugging for troubleshooting
