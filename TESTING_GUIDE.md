# 🧪 Testing Your Production Bell App

## Quick Test Checklist

### ✅ **Single User Test**
1. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser
2. Register a new account (e.g., "alice@test.com", password: "123456")
3. Join a room (e.g., "test-room")
4. Check that camera/microphone access works
5. Test video/audio toggle buttons
6. Send a chat message to yourself

### ✅ **Multi-User Test** (The Real Test!)
1. **First User (Browser 1)**:
   - Open `http://localhost:5173`
   - Register: "alice@test.com" / "123456"
   - Join room: "multi-test"

2. **Second User (Browser 2 - Incognito/Different Browser)**:
   - Open `http://localhost:5173` in incognito/different browser
   - Register: "bob@test.com" / "123456" 
   - Join room: "multi-test"

3. **Expected Results**:
   - ✅ Alice sees Bob join notification
   - ✅ Both users see each other's video feeds
   - ✅ Chat messages appear in real-time for both users
   - ✅ Video/audio toggles work and update for other user
   - ✅ User count shows "2 participants"

### 🔍 **Server Monitoring**
Watch the terminal running `production-server.js` for:
- `🔌 Client connected: [socket-id]`
- `✅ User authenticated: [username]`
- `👥 [username] joined room: [room-id]`
- `💬 Message from [username] in [room-id]`

### 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

#### No video/audio?
- Check browser permissions (click shield/camera icon in address bar)
- Ensure you're on HTTPS or localhost
- Try refreshing the page

#### Users can't see each other?
- Check that both users joined the same room ID
- Verify server logs show both users connected
- Check browser console for WebRTC errors

#### Chat not working?
- Verify WebSocket connection (should show "connected" status)
- Check server logs for message events
- Refresh both browsers and try again

### 📱 **Mobile Testing**
1. Get your network IP: `http://192.168.2.54:5173` (from Vite output)
2. Open on mobile device
3. Test camera flip, touch controls
4. Join same room as desktop user
