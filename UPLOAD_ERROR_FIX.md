      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }

## üîç If Still Not Working

### **Check These:**

#### **1. Is Firebase Storage Enabled?**
- Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Storage
- If you see "Get Started", click it to enable Storage
- Choose a region closest to you
- Click "Done"

#### **2. Check Browser Console for Specific Error**
On mobile:
1. Open Chrome DevTools (desktop)
2. Connect to mobile device, OR
3. Use `chrome://inspect` for remote debugging

Look for error codes like:
- `storage/unauthorized` ‚Üí Rules problem (use rules above)
- `storage/unauthenticated` ‚Üí User not logged in (log out and back in)
- `storage/unknown` ‚Üí Network problem (check connection)
- `storage/quota-exceeded` ‚Üí Storage full (unlikely)

#### **3. Verify User is Logged In**
- Check if profile shows user's email
- Try logging out and back in
- Make sure authentication is working

#### **4. Test with Smaller Image**
- Try uploading a very small image (< 100KB)
- If small works but large doesn't: file size issue
- Resize your photo and try again

#### **5. Check Firebase Storage Location**
- Firebase Console ‚Üí Storage
- Make sure Storage is in the same project as Authentication
- Check if `profile-photos` folder exists (it will be created automatically)
